## Objective
The Voice-Activated AI Guard System integrates **speech recognition** and **facial recognition** to provide real-time room security. The system:

- Responds to voice commands such as `guard my room` or `stop guard`.
- Monitors surroundings for unknown individuals.
- Triggers alarms if unauthorized individuals persist.
- Interacts intelligently with intruders using **Gemini LLM** with multiple escalation levels.

Key objectives:
- Accurate voice-based activation and deactivation of guard mode.
- Identification of unknown individuals using facial recognition.
- Alarm triggering for persistent unknown faces.
- Intelligent interaction with intruders via Gemini LLM.
- Modular, real-time, and efficient operation.

---

## Work Done
- Implemented **audio command recognition** using OpenAI's Whisper model.
- Recorded four-second audio clips via the `sounddevice` library and converted them to text for wake/disarm detection.
- Initially attempted **facial recognition** using Mediapipe Face Mesh (3D embeddings), but switched to `face_recognition` (128-D embeddings) due to inconsistent results.
- Faces with similarity scores below 0.95 are flagged as "Unknown"; alarms trigger after 120 seconds of persistent unknown presence.
- Developed a **GuardAgent class** to manage concurrent audio/video modules using threading.
- WebSocket communication allows real-time remote monitoring.
- Speech feedback is provided via `pyttsx3`, and alarms are handled with `pygame`.
- Integrated **Gemini LLM** (via Google's `genai` Python client) to interact with intruders with multiple escalation levels.

Highlights:
- Robust thread safety and concurrency handling.
- Real-time responsiveness for audio and video modules.
- Modular class structure for clean integration of all components.

## Results and Observations
Testing under varied lighting and noise conditions demonstrated strong system performance:

- **Whisper ASR Accuracy:** ~95% for clear English commands.
- **Face Recognition:** 100% accuracy on enrolled users.
- **Alarm Triggering:** Reliable within 120 seconds of an unknown face persisting.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Stable for over 30 minutes without memory/performance issues.
- **Gemini LLM Interaction:** Provides multi-level escalation responses for detected individuals.

The system achieves real-time surveillance with accurate, intelligent responses.

## Challenges and Debugging
- Configured audio input manually using `sd.default.device` to fix errors.
- Mediapipe initially failed to detect faces or crashed due to improper frame handling; mitigated by validating frames and converting to RGB.
- Switched to `face_recognition` for consistent 128-D embeddings.
- Thread synchronization handled with `threading.Event` flags.
- Alarm persistence issues resolved with proper `pygame` state checks.
- Whisper device mismatches on CPU-only systems fixed by forcing CPU usage.
- Gemini LLM integration posed challenges: continuous listening sometimes captured its own spoken words, causing feedback loops; mitigated with audio locks, TTS safety buffers, and fallback replies.

## Key Takeaways
- Robustness and reproducibility achieved through methodical debugging.
- Independent and combined module testing validated concurrency.
- AI-assisted guidance helped optimize code and detect runtime issues.

## Enrolling Faces

Add new users with the `enroll_face` function:

```python
enroll_face("Vishal", [
    "enrolled_faces/vishal1.jpg",
    "enrolled_faces/vishal2.jpg",
    ...
])
enroll_face("Darshan", [
    "enrolled_faces/darshan1.jpg",
    "enrolled_faces/darshan2.jpg",
    ...
])
```

Replace `...` with additional images as needed.
